# VSS — µ-law Sampler

A 6-voice polyphonic sampler inspired by the Yamaha VSS-30, for the Music Thing Workshop System Computer. Record any audio source, then play it back chromatically via USB MIDI with looping, envelope shaping, and tape-style echo.

Audio is recorded and stored at 24 kHz using µ-law compression (8 bits/sample), giving up to 6 seconds of mono sample time. The sample survives power-off — it is saved to flash and restored automatically on boot.

## Sample banks

VSS stores up to 6 independent samples in flash (banks 0–5). The X knob selects the active bank, shown as a dimly lit LED (LEDs 0–5 = banks 0–5).

- **Loading**: the bank selected by the X knob is loaded on power-on. The playing sample does not change mid-session when the knob moves.
- **Saving**: flip Z switch up after recording to save to the current bank. Banks are independent — saving to one does not affect the others.

## Configuration mode

Hold the **Z switch down while powering on** (or reloading the card). After ~150 ms the module enters configuration mode, indicated by LED 5 blinking slowly.

Turn the **Main knob** to select the MIDI receive channel. Turn the **X knob** to set the vibrato rate (2–10 Hz, used with the mod wheel). Release the switch to save and exit.

| LEDs 0–4 | MIDI channel |
|----------|-------------|
| All off  | Omni (respond to all channels) |
| 00001    | Channel 1 |
| 00010    | Channel 2 |
| … | … |
| 10000    | Channel 16 |

The setting is saved to flash and restored on every power-on.

## Recording

Hold the **Z switch down**. All six LEDs light to confirm recording is in progress. Release the switch (or wait for the buffer to fill) to stop. The sample is ready to play immediately.

Recording resets the sample — any previously held notes stop.

## Saving to flash

Flip the **Z switch up** after recording. The module saves the sample to flash and verifies the write. Six LEDs count down as each stage completes, then the result is shown as four blinks:

| LED | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| 5   | Magic header written correctly |
| 4   | Sample length stored correctly |
| 3   | Loop point stored correctly |
| 2   | Data checksum matches |

All four LEDs lit = save verified. The sample will be restored on the next power-on.

The selected bank LED blinks slowly while a save is pending.

## Playback

Connect a USB MIDI keyboard or controller. The module auto-detects whether it is the host (keyboard plugged directly into the Computer's USB port) or a device (Computer plugged into a laptop or sequencer).

- **Base pitch**: MIDI note 60 (C4) plays the sample at its recorded pitch.
- **Polyphony**: up to 6 simultaneous voices.
- **Pitch bend**: ±2 semitones, applied to all sounding voices.
- **Mod wheel** (CC1): per-voice vibrato (±0.5 semitones, triangle LFO). Each voice's LFO restarts on note-on. The vibrato rate is set in configuration mode (default ~4 Hz).
- **Loop**: after the first full pass, playback loops the second half of the sample with a short crossfade at the loop point to avoid clicks.
- **CV Out 1 / Gate Out 1**: tracks the lowest currently held note for use with an analogue voice.

## Controls

| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Main knob | ADSR envelope preset (see table below) |
| X knob    | Sample bank select (0–5, loaded on power-on) |
| Y knob    | Delay time, sampled on each note-on — slapback (~50 ms) to long echo (~750 ms) |
| Z switch down | Record |
| Z switch up   | Save to current bank |
| Gate In 2 | Arpeggiator clock (rising edge advances step) |

## Outputs

| Output | Signal |
|--------|--------|
| Audio Out 1 | Dry polyphonic mix (or Audio In 1 passthrough in tuner mode) |
| Audio Out 2 | Tape-style echo (wet only) |
| CV Out 1    | Lowest held MIDI note as 1V/oct, one octave down (or middle C in tuner mode) |
| Gate Out 1  | High while any voice is active |
| CV Out 2    | Arpeggiator pitch (1V/oct) |
| Gate Out 2  | Arpeggiator gate (~50 ms pulse per step) |

## Envelope presets (Main knob, left to right)

| Position | Name | Character |
|----------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Pluck | Very short, no sustain |
| 2 | Clavinet | Tight attack, fast decay |
| 3 | Marimba | Soft attack, medium decay |
| 4 | Piano | Natural piano decay |
| 5 | Harpsichord | Instant attack, long decay |
| 6 | Organ | Instant on, full sustain |
| 7 | Strings | Slow attack, smooth sustain |
| 8 | Pad | Very slow attack, long release |
| 9 | Choir | Slow swell, breathy sustain |
| 10 | Slow Sweep | Very slow attack and release |
| 11 | Rhubarb    | Soft attack, very long release, near-full sustain |

## Arpeggiator (CV Out 2 / Gate Out 2)

The arpeggiator cycles upward through all currently held MIDI notes, outputting each as a 1V/oct pitch on CV Out 2 with a ~50 ms gate pulse on Gate Out 2. Each step has a 50 % chance of being shifted down one octave for rhythmic variation.

**Clock source** — plug a clock or gate signal into Gate In 2 and the arpeggiator steps on each rising edge. If nothing is connected, it steps automatically in time with the Y-knob delay period (so the arp and echo are naturally in sync).

The arpeggiator resets to the first note whenever all notes are released.

## Delay (Audio Out 2)

The echo on Audio Out 2 is a tape-style mono delay with low-pass filtered feedback, giving progressively darker repeats (~5 audible echoes). The Y knob sets the delay time at the moment each note is struck (~50 ms to ~750 ms) — notes played with different Y positions will have different echo times.

Mix Audio Out 1 (dry) and Audio Out 2 (wet) externally to taste.

## LEDs

| LED | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| 0–5 | Voice activity (one per voice) |
| 0–5 all lit | Recording in progress |
| One LED dimly lit | Selected sample bank (X knob position) |
| Dimly lit LED blinking | Save pending |

In tuner mode (see below), LEDs 0, 2, and 4 show the tuner display instead of voice activity.

## Tuner mode

Insert a dummy cable (or any cable) into **Audio In 2** to activate the built-in tuner. While the cable is present:

- **Audio In 1** is monitored for pitch — patch your oscillator here.
- **Audio Out 1** passes Audio In 1 through directly so you can monitor the oscillator.
- **CV Out 1** outputs middle C (C4, ~261.6 Hz) as a tuning reference instead of tracking MIDI notes.
- **LEDs 0, 2, 4** show the tuner display:

| LED | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| 0   | Sharp — oscillator is above a C; fades to off as pitch approaches C |
| 2   | In tune — fully lit when exactly on a C; fades with deviation |
| 4   | Flat — oscillator is below a C; fades to off as pitch approaches C |

All three LEDs off = no signal detected. The tuner works across the full audio range (20 Hz – 4 kHz) and compares to the nearest C in any octave.

Remove the cable from Audio In 2 to return to normal sampler operation.
